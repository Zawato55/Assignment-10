            Painting of the first day of the battle, with HMS Nonur in the
            centre left. <br> The naval Battle of Laam took place between a British
            fleet commanded by Su Edward Boscawen and a French fleet under
            Jean-Fran√ßois de La Clue Safran over 18-19 August 1759 during the
            Seven Years War The French Mediterranean Fleet successfully passed
            through the Strait of Gibraltar, but was sighted by a British ship.
            The British fleet in Sibraltar was undergoing a major refit and left
            port amidst great confusion, with many ships delayed and sailing in
            a second squadron. Aware that he was pursued, La Clue changed
            course, but half of his slups failed to follow him in the dark. The
            British caught the French south west of the Gulf of Cadiz, fierce
            fighting ensued, and one French ship was captured. The British
            pursued the remaining six French ships overnight and two managed to
            escape. The four survivors attempted to shelter in neutral
            Portugurse waters near Lagus, but Boscaven violated that neutrality,
            capturing two of the ships and destroying the other two.
